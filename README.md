## Scan in a heartbeat
Helping people sense their heartâ€™s health.

## About
Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is associated with about 17.8 million deaths over the
globe, the cases of which are observed to be especially higher in developing countries
like India by 20-50%. The disease goes undetected until the first heart attack at which
point heart muscles are already weakened due to plaque buildup of cholesterol in
arteries.
BEAT explores a method to detect the onset and progress of CAD through iris of the
eye, easily captured through any smartphone camera, reducing the screening time of
9-12 hours through lipoprotein profile to less than a minute which enables the
technology and medical aid to reach to a far larger population by making the inference
process of online consultations with doctors a lot more efficient
